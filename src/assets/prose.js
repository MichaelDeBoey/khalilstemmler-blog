        I co-founded <a href="https://univjobs.ca">Univjobs</a> in 2017 and learned a lot about making code scale. At some 
        point during my work as a consultant and reading as many <Link to="/books">books</Link> on software as I could digest, I've come to realize that 
        there were a lot of pitfalls I could have avoided if I knew the patterns and principles to guide me. That's what this
