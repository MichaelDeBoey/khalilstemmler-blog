plaindescription: One of several component design principles that states that the "dependency graph of components should have no cycles"
---

In the header image, component A relies on component B which relies on component C.

The problem is that component C also relies on A.

That creates a cycle.

We don't want dependency cycles because they:

- Make the code hard to understand, thus reducing maintainability
- Reduce the quality of the code and improve the likelihood of errors by making it harder to change one component without affecting another
- Make it impossible to test each individual component because they can't be separated
- Have the ability to violate [The Dependency Rule](/wiki/dependency-rule/)

The following example demonstrates a violation of ADP. A cycle exists where `UsernameGenerator` relies on `UserRepo`, which relies on `User`, which relies on `UsernameGenerator`.

## How to fix it?

Two ways:

1. [Dependency Inversion](/articles/tutorials/dependency-injection-inversion-explained). Stick an interface inbetween one of the relationships to **break the cycle**.
2. Rethink your layers. If you've run into cycles like this, it might be a good signal that you're not following <a href="/wiki/dependency-rule/">The Dependency Rule</a>. You can fix that by aiming to understand and separate the concerns of your application into layers. See <a href="/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/clean-nodejs-architecture/">The Clean Architecture</a>.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

This is how we might be able to break a dependency cycle.

### The Dependency Rule

The direction of dependencies should form an _acyclic_ graph where the lower-level components always **rely on/point towards** the higher-level policy.

For example, given the following generic application architecture, notice that all of the outer layer details point towards the inner-layer ones (Domain layer + Application layer)?

That's how you follow the **dependency rule**.
