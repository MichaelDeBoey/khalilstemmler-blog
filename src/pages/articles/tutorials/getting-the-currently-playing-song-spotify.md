## Intro

When I first started builing [khalilstemmler.com](https://khalilstemmler.com), I stubbed out a component to present the current song that I was listening to on Spotify. Y'know, I just wanted to add a cool little feature in order to make the site a little bit more unique.

Fast forward 8 months and it's still not hooked up. After about 4 attempts, I've finally gotten the hard part down (integrating with the API). At some point, I might actually code the React component.

This fun Spotify feature, in addition to several others that I'm thinking about adding for my website and other projects, are part of my [Personal Data Graph](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/stemmlerjs-graph). 

The reason I need a Personal Data Graph for this feature is because in order to fetch authenticated user resources from Spotify, the service that asks for the data needs to be, well- authenticated... as _me_.

The docs from [Spotify's Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) told me that I needed to use the [Authorization Code](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow) approach, one of 3, in order to make this work.

I'm going to plough through this process and show you, very imperatively, the steps involved to authenticate a backend service to act on your behalf to fetch your currently playing song from Spotify.

## Prerequisites

You're going to need to be using Node version 10x or higher for this to work. The reason for that is because the code that talks to Spotify relies on the `URLSearchParams` global.

## Installation and Setup

Clone or fork my repo over at https://github.com/stemmlerjs/stemmlerjs-graph to follow along.

Run the following commands to clone, install, and setup the project.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stemmlerjs/stemmlerjs-graph.git
cd stemmlerjs-graph
npm install
mv .env.template .env
```

## Creating a Spotify Developers Account

Go to the [Spotify Developers Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and sign up for an account.

When you're all signed up, you'll be taken to the Spotify Developers Dashboard that shows your applications. Click "Create An App".

!["Spotify Dashboard"](/img/blog/tutorials/spotify/1-dashboard.png)

<p class="caption">Spotify Developers Dashboard. You won't have an application already when you sign up the first time.</p>

Follow the prompts and select _Non-Commercial_ for the type of integration that we're creating (if you are creating a non-commercial app, that is).

!["Creating a new app"](/img/blog/tutorials/spotify/2-creating-app.png)

!["Finishing registration"](/img/blog/tutorials/spotify/3-non-commercial.png)

## Getting your Client ID and Client Secret

When you login, you should be able to see your Client ID. Underneath it, you can click to see your Client Secret.

!["Access Code and Secret Access Code"](/img/blog/tutorials/spotify/4-client-id-secret.png)

First homework on the repo you cloned is to go into the `.env` file and supply the Client ID and Client Secret into the file for `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`.

<div class="filename">.env</div>

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET= # paste here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET= # paste here as well :-)
```

## Setting up our application

Now we need to configure the application with the **website** and **redirect URI**.

On the dashboard page, click "Edit Settings" and a modal should appear.

!["Finishing registration"](/img/blog/tutorials/spotify/5-configure-app.png)

### Configuring the Website

For `website`, you don't actually need to have a website up and running yet, so just put in the name of a website that you own. 

If you don't own a website, you can use `google.com`.

## Configuring the Redirect URI

This is where Spotify sends us after we've logged in. They send us to the URL that we supply, but also give us back an **authorization code**. _We use that authorization code to get an **access** and **refresh token**_.

If you have a website, you can put _any URL from your domain_ here, and Spotify will redirect us there after logging in.

If you _don't have a website_, again- that's OK, we can use `http://google.com/callback` or something, but do understand that the domain that owns the website that we redirect to is fully capable of reading the **authorization code** we're given back.

<p class="special-quote">When you enter your Redirect URI, don't forget to press the "Add" button beside the URL, and THEN click "Save". That's how attempt #1 of hooking this up failed for me - though you're much smarter so that won't happen to you.</p>

Whatever you've provided as the Redirect URI, make sure to update the `.env` with this as well.

<div class="filename">.env</div>

```bash
...
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URL=https://khalilstemmler.com/callback # For example
```

## Getting the initial Authorization Code

Take this URL and substitute your Client ID and Redirect URI where I've placed `PASTE_HERE`, then paste the entire link into your browser. 

```text
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=PASTE_HERE&
response_type=code&redirect_uri=PASTE_HERE&
scope=user-read-private%20user-read-currently-playing
```

When you paste the link in your browser, you'll be asked to log in using your Facebook or email. Do that. 

Successfully logging in will bring you to this page that asks you to confirm the type of data that we're asking for. The [authorization scope](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/) that we're interested in is being able to see the user's currently playing song. Click "agree" here.

!["Accept scope"](/img/blog/tutorials/spotify/6-accept-scope.png)

After clicking "agree", we'll get sent to the redirect URI that we passed in earlier, but with our **authorization code** as a `code` parameter in the **resulting URL** (check the URL bar).

!["Finishing registration"](/img/blog/tutorials/spotify/7-redirected-url.png)

We're going to want whatever comes after `?code=` in the URL, so copy that.

## Using the Authorization Code to get an Access Token and the Refresh Token

In the root of the repository, run the following script with the code you copied from the URL.

```bash
npm run get-refresh-token <paste-your-code-here>
```

This will ask for a **permanent refresh token** that we can use to make subsequent requests to the API and never have to worry about logging in again (that's dope).

If all goes well, console output should look like this.

!["Getting the refresh token using a script"](/img/blog/tutorials/spotify/8-get-refresh-token-script.png)

Copy the refresh token that was emitted to the console into the `.env` file.

<div class="filename">.env</div>

```bash
...
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN= # Paste the refresh token that we just got here
```

A couple of things to note if this doesn't work for you.

- You have to run this script within _roughly_ a minute of getting the **authorization code** from Spotify. This is a _security by opportunity_- they reduce the total amount of time that someone can use that code hanging out in the open. If you get a 400 error, go back to **Getting the initial Authorization Code** and paste the link again to generate a new **authorization code**.
- It will also fail if you've forgotten to supply the `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URL` values.
- The last reason this might fail is if you're not running Node version 10 or higher.

## Getting the currently playing song via GraphQL Playground 

In [the repo](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/stemmlerjs-graph), I've already gone and done all the hard work of setting up a GraphQL server, defining the schema, and mapping the API results to a song type.

The action happens in [spotifyService.ts](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/stemmlerjs-graph/blob/master/src/modules/spotify/services/spotifyService.ts) which you can peruse if you like. 

If you'd like to play around with the graph via GraphQL playground, simply run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Then go to `http://localhost:4000/`, fire up your Spotify, play some music, and then run this query to see the results.

```graphql
{
  spotifyGetCurrentSongPlaying {
    artist {
      name
    }
    title
    previewUrl
    externalUrl
    currentProgress
  	album {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Voila!

If you're interested in my terrible music taste, pop over to [stemmlerjs-graph.netlify.com](https://stemmlerjs-graph.netlify.com/) and see what I'm listening to currently.

That's it! I hope this helps someone.
