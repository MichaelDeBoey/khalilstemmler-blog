    <p>I'm Khalil, a software developer / designer and (occassional) musician living in Oakville, Canada. I write about </p>

    <p>
      In 2017, I co-founded <a href="https://univjobs.ca">Univjobs</a> and learned a lot about <u>making large Node.js codebases scale</u>. At some point 
      during my work as a consultant and reading as many books on software as I could digest, 
      I came to realize that there were a lot of pitfalls I could have avoided if I knew 
      the patterns and principles to guide me.
