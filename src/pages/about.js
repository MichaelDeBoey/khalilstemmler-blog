    <p>
      <b>Short:</b> I'm Khalil Stemmler, a software developer / designer & musician living in Oakville, Canada. 
      I work as a consultant <a href="https://www.dev6.com/">Aquent | Dev6</a> and I'm the co-founder / CTO 
      of <a href="https://univjobs.ca/">Univjobs</a>. I write and share what I know about 
      JavaScript, building a startup and software design.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Who is this site for:</b> The content I write about on my blog is oriented towards the goal of helping junior 
      or intermediate-level Node and React/Angular developers learn how to apply enterprise software design patterns 
      and principles to write clean and scalable code, usually with TypeScript. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>A bit more:</b> I hold both a Bachelors Degree in <a href="https://brocku.ca/webcal/2013/undergrad/cncc.html">Computer Science</a> from 
      Brock University and a 
      Diploma in <a href="https://academics.sheridancollege.ca/programs/bachelor-of-computing-and-network-communications-honours-internet-communications-technology">Internet Communications Technology</a> from Sheridan College. 
      At this point in my career, I'm
      predominantly interested in Typescript, enterprise application architecture, DDD, business and interface design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Near the end of my undergraduate studies in 2017, after having co-founded Univjobs with my friend, Charles, I divided my spare time between learning how to build, design,
      ship, gather feedback and iterate on software products in the real world.

      Since then, Univjobs has grown to be a platform used by over 7000+ students and recent grads.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I write a lot of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript on a daily basis. If you're interested in the <a href="/uses">tech 
      stacks and tools I use</a>, you can find that out <a href="/uses">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not coding or <a href="/books">reading excellent software books</a>, I like to spend time with my
      beautiful girlfriend, write and record <a href="/music">music</a>, longboard and jog around Oakville.
