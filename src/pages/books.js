    <p>If you know me at all, you know that I'm obsessed with books on 
      software and self-improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Books have some of the greatest return on investment ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, a lot of what I write about are things I've distilled from books and from 
      the experience I've had implementing things I've read from books.
    </p>
    <p>I plan on making this page a space where I can recommend books that I feel
      personally helped me with respect to Design, Development, Lifestyle and Productivity 
      as a developer.

    <p>If you're a Junior Developer, I wrote an article on the <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/9-books-for-junior-developers-in-2019-e41fc7ecc586">Top 9 books for
     Junior Developer in 2019</a>. It includes a bunch of books that I wish I had read earlier because they really helped me get up to speed on the essentials of professional software development.</p>
