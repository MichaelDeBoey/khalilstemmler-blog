## Howdy ü§†

I'm Khalil Stemmler.

<div class="flex align-center">
  <p>I'm a Developer Advocate at <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apollo GraphQL</a>.</p>
  <img style="border-radius: 2px; max-width: 30px; margin-left: 0.5rem;" src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17189275?s=280&v=4"/>

I'm also a Canadian software developer, writer, and (ocassional) musician living in Southern Ontario.

## Connects

If you have any questions for the blog or you'd like to arrange for a speaking engagement, I'd be happy to meet up and chat Apollo, architecture, TypeScript, or DDD. Feel free to <a href="mailto:khalil@khalilstemmler.com">send me an email</a> or ping me on Twitter at [@stemmlerjs](https://twitter.com/stemmlerjs).

I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khalilstemmler/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/stemmlerjs).


## What we do here

The goal of this blog is to:

> Help developers write testable, flexible, and maintainable TypeScript & Node.js.

Now that you're here, you can find a lot of content on:

- [Software Design and Architecture best practices](/articles/categories/software-design/)
- [How to use Domain-Driven Design to build complex applications](/articles/categories/domain-driven-design/)
- [Enterprise Node.js & TypeScript patterns](/articles/categories/enterprise-node-type-script/)
- [How to organize your code and get more done, faster](/resources/names-construct-structure)
- [Web development tutorials & my opinions on when it makes sense to use tech](/articles/categories/web-development/)
- [Software design jargon, but explained as if I'm speaking to a friend](/wiki)
- ...and you'll also find an increasing amount of content on developer productivity with GraphQL + Apollo.

## Who I write for

<p>
  I'm working hard to create <span class="special-green">high-quality</span> content on <span class="special-green">advanced TypeScript + Node.js</span> topics for <span class="special-green">Junior JavaScript Developers</span> who:
  <ul>
    <li>won't tolerate writing any more buggy production code</li>
    <li>want to learn how to write maintainable, testable software</li>
    <li>want to fast-track their way to senior-level roles</li>
    <li>want to learn how to model complex object-oriented software with Node.js</li>
  </ul>
</p>

In 2017, I co-founded (an unsuccessful startup called) <b>Univjobs</b> and learned a lot about <u>making large Node.js codebases scale</u>.

At some point during my work as a consultant and reading as many books on software as I could digest, I came to realize that there were a lot of pitfalls I could have avoided if I knew the patterns and principles to guide me. 

## Current projects

I'm currently working on a couple of projects in addition to my work at Apollo.

- 1. is continuing to answer questions and blog about whatever you're curious about.
- 2. is [solidbook.io - The Software Design and Architecture Handbook](https://solidbook.io) with Node.js and TypeScript.
- 3. is the [Domain-Driven Design course](/courses/domain-driven-design-typescript) with TypeScript.
- 4. is doing the engineering for my buddy Eric from [FoundersBeta](https://www.foundersbeta.com/) on an awesome realtime online job fair to get into startup companies

## Boring stuff about me

I hold both a Bachelors Degree in [Computer Science](https://brocku.ca/webcal/2013/undergrad/cncc.html) from Brock University after a few years of playing with robots, writing LaTex papers, and struggling with math.

I also have a fancy Diploma in [Internet Communications Technology](https://academics.sheridancollege.ca/programs/bachelor-of-computing-and-network-communications-honours-internet-communications-technology) from Sheridan College after a few years of learning how to configure what happens after your packets leave your home router.

## Fun stuff about me

You must really like me if you've read this far üòá 

### Music

I've been writing/recording (and ocassionally performing) music for about 16 years. Will happily chat your ear off about the golden eras of post-punk and hip-hop.
Here are a few more selected works:

- ["College Songs" - highly recommend starting here ‚≠ê](https://soundcloud.com/cyanidecanaries/sets/cyanide-canaries-a). A playlist of some of my best work from 2013-2017.
- ["Bad Faith - EP"](http://badfaith.netlify.app/). An in-progress goth-pop EP about Existentialism. It is influenced by ideas from Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, and the [hypnagogic recording styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogic_pop) popularized by Ariel Pink and John Maus. 
- ["Imperfect Picture"](https://cyanidecanaries.bandcamp.com/track/imperfect-picture). Trip-hop, electronic? I found several ol-timey video clips and worked them into this one.
- ["Mind Your Own"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1SHvinzJlJxlzxgaKhvllk?si=VyDwPI0hSleSu2Qwsp38HA), from a post-punk album I made in a basement in 2017. 
- ["2:35 AM"](https://vimeo.com/259504580), a short that I scored the music for. By Turcin Soylu. (Audio seems a bit bass-boosted unfortunately).
- ["Riot"](https://cyanidecanaries.bandcamp.com/track/riot). Noise rock + trip-hop kind of vibe. Sampled old funk breakbeats and Sonic Youth. This is normally the kind of thing that comes out when I sit down to make something.

<p class="special-quote">I wrote a piece specifically about why I'm drawn to brutalism in art, design, and music. You can read it <a href="http://localhost:8001/blogs/thoughts/brutalist-websites/">here</a>.</p>


### Tech stack

If you're interested in the <a href="/uses">tech stacks and tools I use</a>, you can find that out <a href="/uses">here</a>.

### What else?

When I'm not coding or reading excellent software books (which I really must compile a list for), I write, longboard, and jog around town üèÉ‚Äç.
