description: >-
  This is the seminal book on Design Patterns (and also the name of a damn good post-punk band). What are design patterns, you ask? Design Patterns are well-known solutions to commonly occurring problems in software development. If you’re familiar with the patterns, you’ll find that you’ll be able to greatly reduce the amount of time it takes you to put forth the solutions to those problems.
