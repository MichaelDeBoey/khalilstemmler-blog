  Essential software development patterns, principles and tutorials with modern JavaScript and TypeScript.
</h1>

## Hello, beautiful person
Welcome to the ðŸ”¥ repo for [khalilstemmler.com](https://khalilstemmler.com).

At some point during my work as a consultant and reading as many books on software as I could digest, I've come to realize that there were a lot of pitfalls I could have avoided if I knew the patterns and principles to guide me. That's what this site is about: things **I think** all professional software people should know about.

It's also turning into a place where people can learn about `typescript`, `javascript`, `domain-driven design` and `enterprise typescript`.

Feel free to drop me a line if you'd like to collaborate on an article, a project or simply to leave feedback.

## Contributing
If you find any typos or you'd like to suggest a better way of doing something that I've mentioned in my [articles](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles) or on my [wiki](https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki), definitely consider creating a PR- I'm pretty receptive to feedback.
